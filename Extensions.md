# GEDCOM X Extensions

GEDCOM X is designed from ground up to be extensible in order for the community to use the data in a wide variety of applications.
Here are some of the known GEDCOM X extensions:

*   [Web Services Extension](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-rs)

    The GEDCOM X Web services extension (i.e. "GEDCOM X RS") defines a Web service API for genealogical data. This API is defined as a
    set of [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) Web resources, the links between those resources, the
    HTTP operations that are applicable to those resources, and the inputs and outputs that can be expected from invoking those operations.

*   [Record Extension](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-record)

    The GEDCOM X Record extension defines a set of data types and their associated serialization formats for the purposes of exchanging
    the results of large-scale, field-based extraction of record data from digital images.

*   [Citation Extension](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-citation)

    The GEDCOM X Citation extension defines support for citation fields, citation templates, and their associated enumerated values.
