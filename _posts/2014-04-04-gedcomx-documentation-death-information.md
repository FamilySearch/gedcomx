This post is part of an initiative to improve the available documentation of GEDCOM X. This particular post describes how death-like information found during a research activity might be represented using GEDCOM X.

## Summary

During research for During research for WONG Aloiau (born 1848, Guangdong, China, son of WONG Hin Tai and CHUN Shee, id [`https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/4:1:LDKP-MK3`](https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/4:1:LDKP-MK3)), a researcher visits a grave marker in Honolulu, Hawaii, and takes a digital photograph of the grave marker.  The marker is described by providing a title, citation, and other metadata. A transcription of the marker (which is in Chinese) is provided, as is a translation. Information about the name, birth, death, and burial is extracted from the marker. The extracted information is assembled together with information extracted from other records to aggregate what is presumed to be known about WONG Aloiau.

## Gathering the Information

A researcher visits the Manoa Chinese Cemetery (a.k.a. Lin Yee Chung Cemetery) in Honolulu, Hawaii and takes a photograph of the grave marker for WONG Aloiau. The following is the digital image of the marker:

#### Analyzing the Information

The researcher analyzes the grave marker within the context of the other records of WONG Aloiau she has found. She writes an analysis document that details her conclusions of the identity of WONG Aloiau.

## Representing the Information

The information gathered is represented using GEDCOM X as follows:

#### Create the GEDCOM X Root Document

All GEDCOM X information is contained within a "root" document. When the document is created, the software being used by the researcher provides information about who can be attributed the information.

The following snippet demonstrates how a root document is initialized in both XML and JSON. The information within the document is dated March 7, 2014 and attributed to a user named "Jane Doe" with an e-mail address of "example@example.org". An instance of the [`Agent`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#agent) data type is provided to describe the contributor, and an instance of the [`Attribution`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#attribution) data type is provided to attribute the information to the contributor.

#### The Grave Stone and Its Digital Image

The gravestone and its digial image are each described by providing an instance of the [`SourceDescription`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#source-description) data type in the root document. The following snippet demonstrates how the sources are described in both XML and JSON. The source descriptions include a title, a citation, and a reference to the cemetery, which is represented using an [`Agent`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#agent). Note that the digital image cites the physical grave stone as a source.

#### The Extracted Information

The information that is extracted from the source is represented as persons and relationships. An instance of the [`Person`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#person) data type provides person information and an instance of the [`Relationship`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#relationship) data type provides relationship information.

The following snippet demonstrates how the extracted information is represented in both XML and JSON. Each person is designated as `extracted` because the information was extracted from a single source. Each person includes a name, an id, and a reference to the translation as a source. The birth, death, and burial information is included on the principal person.

#### The Analysis

Following good research process practices, the researcher writes up a document that describes her analysis of the information about WONG Aloiau that was discovered. Presumably, other sources in addition to the gravestone were located and their analysis would be included in the document.

The aggregated analysis, including the text of the document, is represented with another [`Person`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#person) that references the extracted information as evidence using instances of [`EvidenceReference`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#evidence-reference). The following snippet demonstrates how the analysis is represented in both XML and JSON.
