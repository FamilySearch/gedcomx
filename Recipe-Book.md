Ever have a question like the following?

> How does GEDCOM X handle &lt;insert-special-case-here&gt;?

A recipe intends to address a specific question about how the GEDCOM X model is to be used in a specific use case. For each
use case, there could be multiple, equally valid ways to address the requirements and a recipe intends to facilitate
interoperability by officially recommending a specific use of the model.
