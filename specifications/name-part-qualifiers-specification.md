## Summary

The GEDCOM X Name Part Qualifiers spec provides a set of enumerated values that identify common qualifiers of name parts that are relevant to genealogical research. The spec includes notational conventions, the URI reference, and name part qualifiers. 

# 1. Introduction

An enumeration of name part qualifiers provides the means for parts of names of persons to
be described and qualified in such a way so as to be semantically processed by applications,
rather than being only interpreted by people. This specification provides such an enumeration
by identifying specific name part qualifiers and defining the semantic significance of each
qualifier.

A name part qualifier may be used to identify how the name part was used by the person to which the name
applies. For example, a name part qualifier may specify that a given name part was used by the person
as a `Title`.

## 1.1 Identifier and Version

The identifier for this specification is:

`http://gedcomx.org/name-part-qualifiers/v1`

For convenience, this specification may be referred to as "GEDCOM X Name Part Qualifiers 1.0".
This specification uses "GEDCOM X Name Part Qualifiers" internally.

## 1.2 Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), as scoped to those conformance
targets.

## 1.2.1 The URI Reference

The Uniform Resource Identifier ("URI") is used to identify event types. The URI is
specified by [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). This specification uses the term
"URI" to refer to both a "URI" and a "URI Reference" as defined by
[RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

# 2. Name Part Qualifiers

The following name part qualifiers are specified. Note that in addition to the name of the qualifier,
the definition of a qualifier includes an optional `value` property. Included in the definition of each name
part qualifier is information about whether the `value` property should be used.
