[GEDCOM X standard conceptual model](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md),
and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

The current state of this document is as a "stable draft", and as such, the document

## Summary

The GEDCOM X Standard Header Set spec specifies the set of metadata terms that are recognized for genealogical resources and the mechanism for providing that metadata. It supports the [GEDCOM X File Format](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/file-format-specification.md). The spec includes notational conventions, providing headers, header values, and the standard header set.

# 1. Introduction

When processing a set of genealogical resources (such as those defined by the
[GEDCOM X standard conceptual model](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md))
it is often useful--sometimes even necessary--to process metadata for the resource before processing
it. Examples of this kind of metadata include:

* The data format for the resource.
* Caching directives such as the last modified timestamp or version.
* Identifiers for the resource.
* Bibliographic metadata, such as a bibliographic citation.
* Display names or titles.

The GEDCOM X Standard Header Set specifies the set of metadata terms that are
recognized for genealogical resources and the mechanism for providing that metadata.

## 1.1 Identifier, Version, and Dependencies

The identifier for this specification is:

`http://gedcomx.org/headers/v1`

For convenience, this specification may be referred to as "GEDCOM X Standard Header Set 1.0".
This specification uses "GEDCOM X Headers" internally.

This specification depends on [RFC 822](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/) to define the mechanism
for supplying headers.

This specification depends on the GEDCOM X Date Format identified
by [`http://gedcomx.org/date/v1`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/date-format-specification.md).

This specification imports some of the [HTTP Standard Headers](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)
as defined by [RFC 2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).

<a name="notational-conventions"/>

## 1.2 Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), as scoped to those conformance
targets.

# 2. Providing Headers

Headers are provided follow the same generic format as that given in Section 3.1 of
[RFC 822](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). Each header consists of a name
followed by a colon (":") and the header value. Header names are case-insensitive. The
value MAY be preceded by any amount of LWS, though a single SP is preferred.
Headers can be extended over multiple lines by preceding each extra line with at
least one SP or HT. The header values contain either text or combinations of token,
separators, and quoted-string as specified by RFC 822.

The order in which header fields with differing field names are received is not significant.

<a name="header-values"/>

# 3. Header Values

Each header MAY supply multiple values. This is done either in a single name-value pair
by separating each value by a comma OR in multiple headers of the same name. Order of
the values MUST be preserved and MAY be significant based on the definition of the header.

<a name="text-headers"/>

## 3.1. Text Headers

Values of headers designated as text headers are to be interpreted as text.

<a name="uri-headers"/>

## 3.2. URI Headers

Values of headers designated as URI headers are to be interpreted as a URI that
identifies the value of the metadata. For cases in which the value of the metadata
may not have an identifier except for its text value, the text value is
encoded according to the data URI scheme defined by [RFC 2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397).

<a name="date-headers"/>

## 3.3. Date Headers

Values of headers designated as date headers are to be interpreted as dates
according to the [GEDCOM X Date Format](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/date-format-specification.md).
