## Summary

The GEDCOM X Date Format spec specifies a mechanism for representing dates, especially as they pertain to the need to represent genealogical dates. The spec includes definitions, date ranges, date formats and URI representation examples.

<a name="intro"/>

# 1. Introduction

The GEDCOM X Date specification defines a way of representing dates associated with genealogical data.

This specification is heavily based on the [ISO 8601](http://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf)
standard, the [RFC 3339](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) proposal, and [W3C's *profile*]
(http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) of ISO 8601. Concepts from the
[Dublin Core Date and Time Requirements Wiki](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) were also leveraged.

This specification has been provided because each of these standards or proposals individually has
limitations or omissions that do not fulfill the requirements identified for genealogical date
representations.

<a name="keywords"/>

### 1.2.1 Keywords

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), as scoped to those conformance
targets.

<a name="terms-and-definitions"/>

# 2. Terms and Definitions

For the purpose of this document, the following terms and definitions apply _in addition to_
those defined by [ISO 8601](http://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf).

<a name="basic-terms"/>

## 2.1 Basic Terms

<a name="calendar date"/>

### 2.1.1 calendar date

Portion of a date representing a particular day by specifying its calendar year, its calendar
month and the ordinal number of the day within its calendar month.

<a name="time-of-day"/>

### 2.1.2 time of day

Portion remaining from a date if the calendar date portion is ignored, represented in
units of _hours_, _minutes_, and _seconds_.

NOTE: By implication, time of day must be less than 24 hours.

<a name="CE"/>

### 2.1.3 CE

Abbreviation of "Common Era", "Current Era", or "Christian Era". Equivalent to "Anno Domini", or "AD".

<a name="BCE"/>

### 2.1.4 BCE

Abbreviation for "Before the Common Era", "Before the Current Era", or "Before the Christian Era".
The designation "BCE" is to "CE", as "BC" is to "AD".

NOTE: The year preceding 1 CE is identified as "1 BCE". Neither designation uses year 0 (zero).

<a name="Gregorian"/>

### 2.1.5 Gregorian calendar

A calendar introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII that enhanced the Julian calendar with improved leap year rules.

NOTE: The _proleptic_ Gregorian calendar includes dates prior to 1582 using this calendaring system.

<a name="simple-date"/>

### 2.1.6 simple date

A date representing a single calendar date, and optionally including a time of day. This term is used
to clarify the distinction between a generic _date_  and the aggregation of the GEDCOM X Date types
of values (e.g. `simple date`, `date range`, `open-ended date range`, and `approximate date`).

<a name="date-range"/>

### 2.1.7 date range

A time interval can be specified by a _start date_ and an _end date_ (both instances of `simple date`) or by specifying a
_start date_ (a `simple date`) and a _duration_.  Date ranges MAY be either "closed" (both end points are specified
or can be calculated) or "open-ended" (only one end-point is specified).

Examples of `closed date range`:

* From January 1863 CE to December 14, 1642 CE

Examples of `open-ended date range`

* Before January 1863 CE
* After December 14, 1642 CE

<a name="recurring-date"/>

### 2.1.8 recurring date

A series of discrete dates, separated by a specified duration.

Examples:

* 10 leap years beginning 1924 CE
* at the same time every day for a week starting at June 18, 1937 CE 10 AM local time
* every 10 years starting 1820 CE

<a name="approximate-date"/>

### 2.1.9 approximate date

An indeterminate date with a single occurrence roughly centered on a specified `simple date`.

Examples:

* About January 1777
* Around 1590
* Sometime in 1920

<a name="approximate-date-range"/>

### 2.1.10 approximate date range

An indeterminate date with a single occurrence within a specified `date range`.

Examples:

* Sometime between December 6, 1940 and December 8, 1940

<a name="scope"/>

# 3. Scope

The GEDCOM X Date represents one of the following:

* a simple date
* a date range
* a recurring date
* an approximate date
* an approximate date range

<a name="3-1-simple-date"/>

## 3.1 Simple Date

The precision of a `simple date` is based on the smallest provided unit of measure.

The GEDCOM X Date units of measurement include, and are limited to `year`, `month`,
`day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`.  For a given `simple date`, all units of measurement
larger than the smallest unit specified MUST be provided.

<a name="3-2-date-range"/>

## 3.2 Date Range

A `date range` MUST be either a `closed date range` or an `open-ended date range`.

<a name="closed-date-range"/>

### 3.2.1 Closed Date Range

A `closed date range` MUST be _one_ of the following:

* _start date_ and _end date_
* _start date_ and `duration`

<a name="open-ended-date-range"/>

### 3.2.2 Open-Ended Date Range

An `open-ended date range` MUST include either the _start date_ or
the _end date_, but NOT both.

<a name="3-3-recurring-date"/>

## 3.3 Recurring Date

A `recurring date` is represented by a `closed date range` providing the following:

* REQUIRED: a _start date_ (or reference date)
* REQUIRED: the time interval between occurrences (calculated as the interval between the _start date_ and the _end date_, or as the interval specified by the `duration`)
* OPTIONAL: the number of recurrences

NOTE: If no recurrence count is provided, the recurrences are considered _perpetual_.

<a name="3-4-approximate-date"/>

## 3.4 Approximate Date

An `approximate date` is represented by providing _all_ of the following:

* an indicator that the date is _approximate_
* a `simple date`

<a name="3-5-approximate-date-range"/>

## 3.5 Approximate Date Range

An `approximate date range` is represented by providing _all_ of the following:

* an indicator that the date is _approximate_
* a `date range`

<a name="calendaring-system"/>

# 4. Calendaring System

In order to provide consistency in interpretation of a date, a common calendaring and
time system is specified as follows:

* Dates MUST be specified using the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
* The earliest representable date is January 1, 10000 BCE.
* The latest representable date is December 31, 9999 CE.
* Years are provided as follows:
    * The year prior to 1 CE ("Common Era or "AD") MUST be represented as the year 0.
    * Any year prior to year 0 MUST be represented as a _negative number_.

<a name="format"/>

# 5. Format

<a name="characters-used-date-representation"/>

## 5.1 Characters Used in Date Representation

The following letters are used as value designators, and _precede_ the value:

* [A] - designates an `approximate date`
* [P] - designates the component as a duration
* [R] - designates a recurrence count for a `recurring date range`

The following characters are used as value separators:

* [T] - separates the `calendar date` portion of a `date` or `duration` from the `time of day` portion
* [Z] - designates the date is based on UTC time
* [-] - separates the values of the `calendar date` portion's units of a date
* [:] - separates the values of the `time of day` portion's units of a date
* [/] - separates the components of a `date range` or `recurring date range`

<a name="5-2-simple-date"/>

## 5.2 Simple Date

<a name="representation"/>

### 5.2.1 Representation

In the format for a `simple date`, letters are used to represent digits of the date as follows:

* [Y] - digit used in the year
* [M] - digit used in the month
* [D] - digit used in the day of month
* [h] - digit used in the hour
* [m] - digit used in the minute
* [s] - digit used in the second
* [z] - digit used in the local time offset
* [±] represents a plus sign [+] if the following element's value is positive or zero, or a minus sign
  [-] if the following element's value is negative.

The format for a complete `simple date` is defined as follows:

```
±YYYY[-MM[-DD[Thh:[mm[:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]]]]]]
```

<a name="5-2-description"/>

### 5.2.2 Description

The complete `simple date` format specifies the format of all components and their order (largest to
smallest units). Unit components MAY be truncated right-to-left, to indicate precision level of the
date.

<a name="calendar-date-part"/>

#### 5.2.2.1 Calendar date part

The year component is defined as a REQUIRED [+] or [-] and four digits, left-padded with zeros as
needed. Valid values range from -9999 to +9999. The year component MUST always be present as part of a
simple date, and is the maximal unit of precision.

The month component MUST be 2 digits when present, with values of between `01` and `12`.

The day of month component MUST be 2 digits when present. The range of valid values is
determined by the number of days in that proleptic Gregorian calendar month, with the
first day of the month designated as `01`.

<a name="time-of-day-part"/>

#### 5.2.2.2 Time of day part

If any time component is present, the character [T] MUST precede the time of day component.

Hours are based on a 24-hour day, and MUST have a value between 00 and 23. In the special case where the
minute and second components have zero values, the value 24 is valid, representing midnight at
the end of the calendar day. Likewise, if all three components have the value 00, it represents midnight
at the beginning of the specified calendar day.

When any time of day is specified, there are three options for specifying its geographical reference:

* No specifier implies local time
* [Z] specifies UTC
* four digits (with a colon separator), preceded by a [+] or [-] indicates the shift of local time from UTC
   * This is usually referred to as the local "time zone"
   * The [+] or [-] character is REQUIRED
   * The first 2 digits represent the hours
   * The last 2 digits represent minutes, and MAY be omitted if zero

<a name="examples"/>

### 5.2.3 Examples

example | textual description
--------|------------
+1752-01-18T22:14:3Z | January 18, 1752 CE 10:14 and 3 seconds PM UTC
+1964-11-14T10-07:00 | November 14, 1964 CE 10 AM, Mountain Standard Time
+1889-05-17T14:23 | May 17, 1889 CE 2:23 PM
+1492-07-27 | July 27, 1492 CE (presumed to be "local time", honoring the International Date Line)
+0186-03 | March 186 CE
-1321 | 1322 BCE

<a name="duration"/>

## 5.3 Duration

<a name="5-3-representation"/>

### 5.3.1 Representation

The initial [P] designates the value is a `duration`. The part including time components MUST be preceded by [T].

In the format representations for a `duration`, a digit is represented by the letter [n]. Letters have specific
meaning, are literal, and represent the following units:

* [Y] The number of years
* [M] The number of months or minutes (determined by context)
* [D] The number of days
* [H] The number of hours
* [S] The number of seconds

The format for a complete duration is defined as follows:

```
PnnnnYnnMnnDTnnHnnMnnS
```

<a name="5-3-description"/>

### 5.3.2 Description

A date `duration` can be represented by a combination of components/units with designators, with the following
guidelines and restrictions:

* Each component is OPTIONAL, and MAY be omitted.
    * If any time component is present, the [T] MUST precede the time of day part.
* All components present MUST appear in hierarchical order, largest to smallest units.
* Components are **NOT** REQUIRED to be normalized.
    * Any non-normalized unit MAY be represented with up to four digits.
    * For example, the descriptive values "13 months" and "2 years, 52 days" each contain non-normalized values and both are considered acceptable.

NOTE: For a duration, local time and UTC distinction is meaningless.

NOTE: A GEDCOM X Date MAY contain a `duration`, but MUST NOT solely represent a `duration` itself.

<a name="5-3-examples"/>

### 5.3.3 Examples

example | textual description
--------|--------------------
P17Y6M2D | duration of 17 years, 6 months, and 2 days
P186D | duration of 186 days
PT5H17M | lapsed time: 5 hours 17 minutes
P1000Y18M72DT56H10M1S | 1000 years 18 months 72 days 56 hours 10 minutes 1 second

<a name="5-4-closed-date-range"/>

## 5.4 Closed Date Range

<a name="5-4-representation"/>

### 5.4.1 Representation

The format for a complete `date range` is a _start date_ and an _end date_ (both `simple dates`), separated by a [/]:

```
±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]/±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]
```

_or_ a _start date_ (a `simple date`) and a `duration`, separated by a [/]:

```
±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]/PnnnnYnnMnnDTnnHnnMnnS
```

In either format, the presence of the slash character [/] indicates the date is a `date range`.


<a name="start-date-constraints" />

#### 5.4.1.1 Start Date Constraints

The _start date_ (the `simple date` preceding the slash) MUST NOT be greater than maximum `simple date` (+9999-12-31T23:59:59)
and MUST be earlier than or equivalent to the _end date_ (the `simple date` following the slash).

NOTE: It is not required that the precision of the two `simple dates` be the same.

<a name="duration-constraints"/>

#### 5.4.1.2 Duration Constraints

The `duration` MUST be such that the calculated _end date_ is earlier or equivalent to the maximum `simple date` (+9999-12-31T23:59:59).

NOTE: It is not required that the precision of the _start date_ and the `duration` be the same.
The precision of the equivalent _end date_ is the coarser precision of the _start date_ and the
`duration`.

<a name="5-4-examples"/>

### 5.4.2 Examples

example | textual description
--------|--------------------
+1752/+1823 | from 1752 CE to 1823 CE
+1825-04-13/+1825-11-26 | from April 13, 1825 to November 26, 1825
+1933-02-19/P74Y | 74 years, starting on February 19, 1933, i.e. from February 19, 1933 to February 19, 2007

<a name="open-Ended-date-range"/>

## 5.5 Open-Ended Date Range

<a name="5-5-representation"/>

### 5.5.1 Representation

An `open-ended date range` MUST be a `date range` where
either the _start date_ or _end date_ is explicitly missing.

A leading slash character [/] is used to specify a date range *before* the provided _end date_:

```
/±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]
```

A trailing slash character [/] is used to specify a date range *after* the provided _start date_:

```
±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]/
```

<a name="5-5-examples"/>

### 5.5.2 Examples

example | textual description
--------|--------------------
/+1887-03 | before March, 1887 CE
+1976-07-11/ | after July 11, 1976 CE
/-1287 | before 1288 BCE
/+0000 | before 1 BCE
-0001-04/ | after April, 2 BCE

<a name="5-6-recurring-date"/>

## 5.6 Recurring Date

<a name="5-6-representation"/>

### 5.6.1 Representation

The format for a `recurring date` is defined as either:

```
R[n]/±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]/±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]
```

or

```
R[n]/±YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[±hh[:mm]|Z]/PnnnnYnnMnnDTnnHnnMnnS
```

<a name="5-6-description"/>

### 5.6.2 Description

The `recurring date` is defined in terms of a `closed date range`&mdash; where _start date_ is the _reference date_
and the recurring _interval_ is calculated as the interval between the _start date_ and the _end date_ or the interval
specified by the `duration`&mdash;prepended with an [R], an OPTIONAL recurrence count, and a slash [/].

<a name="5-6-examples"/>

### 5.6.3 Examples

example | descriptive use case
--------|---------------------
R4/+1776-04-02/+1776-04-09 | every week, for 4 weeks starting on July 2, 1776 CE
R/+2000/P12Y | the Chinese *Year of the Dragon* occurs every 12 years (perpetually), including the year 2000 CE
R100/+1830/+1840 | the US census occurs every 10 years starting in 1830, for 100 repetitions

<a name="5-approximate-date"/>

## 5.7 Approximate Date

The format for an `approximate date` is defined as a `simple date` prepended by the character [A].

<a name="5-7-examples"/>

### 5.7.1 Examples

<a name="uri-representation"/>

# 6. URI Representation

A GEDCOM X Date MAY be identified using a Uniform Resource Identifier (*URI*) as defined by [RFC-2396](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt). A URI
that identfies a GEDCOM X Date is of the following format:

```
gedcomx-date:<GEDCOM X Date value>
```

NOTE: The URI scheme is `gedcomx-date` and the scheme-specific part is the representation of the date as defined
by this specification.

<a name="6-1-examples"/>

## 6.1 Examples

example type | description | applicable URI
-------------|-------------|----
simple date | Sept 14, 1863 | `gedcomx-date:+1863-09-14`
approx. date | about 1742 | `gedcomx-date:A+1742`
date range | between October 1834 and May 1835 | `gedcomx-date:+1834-10/+1835-05`

<a name="appendix-a"/>

# APPENDIX A: Implementation Hints and Observations

The following summaries may be beneficial in parsing and composing GEDCOM X Dates using this specification:

<a name="parsing-gedcomx-dates"/>

## 1. Parsing GEDCOM X Dates

1. Any value that begins with a [+] or a [-] must be a `simple date`.
    * The [-] will only affect the year component.
    * A negative `simple date` year component can always be converted to a BCE Gregorian year by adding 1 to the absolute value.
2. Any value that begins with a [P] must be a `duration`.
3. A leading [A] is **always** an `approximate date`, and **must** be followed by either a `simple date` or a `date range`.
4. A leading [R] is **always** a `recurring date range`.
5. A slash [/] always separates values, and its presence always indicates a `date range` (including *open-ended* and *recurring* date ranges).
6. A [T] always separates the `calendar date` (calendar units) from the `time of day` (time units).
7. Each component of a `simple date` has a fixed width, always preceded by a designated character in the set [±,-,T,:].
    * All components, except the year component have length of 3, including the delimiting prefix character.
    * The year component has length of 5 (and the prefix is always [+] or [-]).
    * When provided, local time _offset_ has a length of 6, two components (hours and minutes) each of length 3.
