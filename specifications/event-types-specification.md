## Summary

The GEDCOM X Event Types spec specifies a set of enumerated values that identify common event types that are relevant to genealogical research. An "event" is an occurrence that happened at a specific time or period of time, often at a specific place or set of places. Genealogically relevant events are often described by referencing the persons that played a role in that event. Hence, events often refer to persons and might infer relationships, but events are described independently of those persons and relationships. The spec includes notational conventions, event types, and the URI reference used to identify event types.

# 1. Introduction

An enumeration of types of events provides the means for descriptions of historical events to
be semantically processed by applications, rather than being only interpreted by people. This
specification provides such an enumeration by identifying specific event types and defining
the semantic significance of each type.

## 1.1 Identifier and Version

The identifier for this specification is:

`http://gedcomx.org/event-types/v1`

For convenience, this specification may be referred to as "GEDCOM X Event Types 1.0".
This specification uses "GEDCOM X Event Types" internally.

## 1.2 Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), as scoped to those conformance
targets.

## 1.2.1 The URI Reference

The Uniform Resource Identifier ("URI") is used to identify event types. The URI is
specified by [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). This specification uses the term
"URI" to refer to both a "URI" and a "URI Reference" as defined by
[RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).
