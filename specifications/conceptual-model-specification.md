# 1. Introduction

The GEDCOM X conceptual model is a specification of formal concepts and types
that are used to provide a standard model and vocabulary for describing genealogical
data. Genealogical data is structured by data types such as persons, 
relationships, and sources.

## 1.1 Identifier and Version

The identifier for this specification is:

`http://gedcomx.org/conceptual-model/v1`

For convenience, the GEDCOM X conceptual model may be referred to as "GEDCOM X 1.0".
This specification uses "GEDCOM X" internally.

## 1.2 Notational Conventions

This specification uses the term "data type" to refer to a formal description of
a data structure, including the properties that define valid instances of the
data type. For example, information about a person might be contained within a 
data structure that supplies the person's name, birth date, and gender. A "data 
type" defines the formal properties of the data structure.

When a property of a data type is specified as being of a particular data type, the
property inherits the corresponding requirements from that data type's definition.
When a data type is specified as an extension of another data type, the extending
data type inherits the corresponding requirements from the extended data type's
definition.

Data types are defined by the following sections:

1. The *identifier* for the data type, which takes the form of a URI.
2. The *extension* of the data type (if any) which specifies which data type
   is extended by the data type.
3. The *properties* of the data type, which define the information the data type
   encapsulates.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, 
[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), as scoped to those conformance 
targets.



# 2. Common Data Types

Many data types of the GEDCOM X conceptual model share common structures. This section
defines the data types of those shared structures and their requirements for convenient
reference by the other data type definitions.


<a id="uri"/>

## 2.1 The URI

The Uniform Resource Identifier ("URI") is fundamental to the GEDCOM X conceptual model.
The URI is used to identify specific resources, such as persons, relationships, and 
sources. The URI is also used to identify the data structures that describe those resources
and even the data types that define those data structures. The URI is specified by
[RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).


<a id="identifier-type"/>


## 2.2 The "Identifier" Data Type

The `Identifier` data type defines the data structure used to supply an identifier of a 
genealogical resource in a specific data set.

The `Identifier` data type does NOT support extension properties (see [Extension Properties](#extension-properties)).

### identifier

The identifier for the "Identifier" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Identifier`

### properties

name  | description | data type
------|-------------|----------
value | The value of the identifier. | string (possibly interpreted as a URI, depending on the type of the identifier).
type  | URI identifying the type of the identifier. | [URI](#uri) - MUST resolve to an identifier type. Refer to the list of [known identifier types](#known-identifier-types).

<a id="known-identifier-types"/>

### known identifier types

The following identifier types are defined by GEDCOM X.

URI | description
----|------------
`http://gedcomx.org/Primary` | The primary identifier for the resource.
`http://gedcomx.org/Deprecated` | An identifier that has been relegated, deprecated, or otherwise downgraded. This identifier is commonly used as the result of a merge when what was once a primary identifier for a person is no longer primary.
`http://gedcomx.org/Persistent` | An identifier that is considered to be a long-term persistent identifier. Applications that provide persistent identifiers are claiming that links to the resource using the identifier won't break.

### examples

todo: fill in some examples.


<a id="attribution"/>

## 2.3 The "Attribution" Data Type

The `Attribution` data type defines the data structure used to attribute _who_, _when_, and _why_ to
genealogical data. Data is attributed to the agent who made the _latest significant change_ to the nature
of the data being attributed. The definition of a "significant change" is outside the scope of this specification
and is left to the implementer of the application.

#### The Granularity of Attribution

The granularity of data that is attributed varies widely from application to application. Some highly collaborative applications
might take a fine-grained approach, tracking attribution at the level of names, facts, and source references. Single-user
applications might simply provide attribution for a large set of data, such as an entire data tree. GEDCOM X explicitly
defines attribution for top-level entities such as persons, relationships, and documents, but also recognizes attribution
as an extension property that can be applied at a finer level of granularity. (For more information about extension properties,
see Section 6). For all data types where attribution explicitly recognized, it is an OPTIONAL property.

If data is not explicitly attributed, the attribution for the data is assumed to be the attribution for the containing
data. For example, if no attribution is provided for the name of a person (as an extension property of the name), then the
attribution for the name is assumed to be the attribution of the person that contains the name. If no attribution for the
person is provided, the attribution is assumed to be the attribution for the data set that contains the person.

### identifier

The identifier for the "Attribution" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Attribution`

### properties

name  | description | data type
------|-------------|----------
contributor | Reference to the contributor to whom the attributed data is attributed. | [URI](#uri) - MUST resolve to an instance of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Agent`](#agent).
modified | Timestamp of when the attributed data was contributed. | timestamp
changeMessage | A statement of why the attributed data is being provided by the contributor. | string

<a id="formal-value"/>

## 2.4 The "FormalValue" Data Type

The `FormalValue` data type defines the data structure used to supply a normalized and/or
standardized value. The formal value is used to supply a formal interpretation of a
value that has been supplied by a user. If the value has been reformatted for the purpose of easier
processing (e.g. for display purposes), it is said to be "normalized". If the value has
been resolved to a discrete, machine-identifiable value based on a specific standard, it is
said to be "standardized".

The `FormalValue` data type does NOT support extension properties (see [Extension Properties](#extension-properties)).

### identifier

The identifier for the "FormalValue" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/FormalValue`

### properties

name  | description | data type
------|-------------|----------
value | A string supplying the value of the formal value. If the value has been standardized, a datatype will be supplied to identify how the string is to be parsed. | string
datatype  | URI identifying the way the value is to be processed according to a specific standard. | [URI](#uri)
resource | URI identifying the resource to which the formal value has been standardized. | [URI](#uri)

If a value is supplied for the `datatype` property, a value SHALL NOT be supplied for the `resource` property.
If a value is supplied for the `resource` property, a value SHALL NOT be supplied for the `datatype` property.

### examples

* A user supplies the text "jan 1 1890" as the value of a genealogical date. If a process
  (either automated or by user-interaction) normalizes this text to "1 January 1890", the formal
  value containing the results of this normalization will have a value of "1 January 1890"
  and no values specified for either the datatype or the resource.
* A user supplies the text "jan 1 1890" as the value of a genealogical date. If a process
  (either automated or by user-interaction) standardizes this text to a specific date such as
  midnight UTC of the first day of January of the year 1890 A.D. of the Gregorian calendar,
  the formal value containing the results of this standardization might have a value of
  "1890-01-01T00:00:00Z" and a datatype of "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime" and no value
  specified for the resource.
* A user supplies "boston, MA" as the value for a genealogical place. If a process (either
  automated or by user-interaction) standardizes this place to a unique resource (e.g. the
  actual city know today as Boston, Massachusetts) identified by a specific URI (e.g.
  "http://places.com/12345"), the formal value containing the results of this standardization
  will have "http://places.com/12345" as the value of its "resource" property. The formal value
  MAY also supply a value for the "value" property that contains the results of normalizing
  the user-supplied text (e.g. "Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts, United States").


<a id="note"/>

## 2.5 The "Note" Data Type

The `Note` data type defines a note that was contributed from genealogical research.

Notes are not intended to contain genealogical conclusions.  Notes are only associated with a single genealogical resource.

### identifier

The identifier for the "Note" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Note`

### properties

name  | description | data type
------|-------------|----------
text | The text of the note. | [`http://gedcomx.org/TextValue`](#text-value)
attribution | The attribution of this note. | [`http://gedcomx.org/Attribution`](#attribution)


<a id="text-value"/>

## 2.7 The "TextValue" Data Type

The `TextValue` data type defines a literal value.

The `TextValue` data type does NOT support extension properties (see [Extension Properties](#extension-properties)).

### identifier

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/TextValue`

### properties

name  | description | data type
------|-------------|----------
lang | The language of the literal value. | `http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace#lang`
value | The literal value. A datatype MAY be supplied to identify how the string is to be parsed. | string



# 3. Data Types for Describing Sources

Citing sound evidence is a critical component to the exchange of genealogical data. The source of
a piece of genealogical data has to be completely and accurately described in order to be
consistently evaluated by other genealogical researchers. Many sources do not have a digital
representation (e.g. books or other physical artifacts). Sources are instead _described_
and their _description_ is provided as the digital representation of a source.

This section defines the data types that are used for describing and referencing sources.

Building source citations is said to be an "art" and requires a great deal of flexibility.  While citation style
guides exist (e.g. Chicago style, Turabian, Evidence Style -- see <i>Evidence Explained</i> by Elizabeth Shown Mills,
etc.), they are considered guides and execution within their guidelines allows for flexibility.
No one style has been universally accepted, nor will a style become universally accepted in the forseeable future.  Therefore,
the approach to collecting citation metadata and the exchange of this data needs to support flexibility.
</p><p/><p>
The citation metadata is collected as a set of name-value pairs (see the CitationField data type), but there still remains
a set of difficult questions, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the set of valid "names" (e.g. controlled vocabulary)?</li>
  <li>What "values" are valid values for a given "name"?</li>
  <li>What fields (name-value pairs) are required, and under what circumstances might they be optional?</li>
  <li>What metadata needs to be collected to properly site data in a specific record?  For example, is a citation for the 1900 US Census
different from a citation for the 1910 US Census and from a citation for the 1911 England and Wales Census?</li>
</ul>
<p/><p>
Further questions remain about how to arrange the fields into citations. For example, given a set of metadata, can it be expressed
in the Chicago style?  The Evidence style?  What about a lesser-used or custom style?
</p><p/><p>
To address these design issues, we define <b><i>citation templates</i></b>.  A citation template defines the metadata that should
be collected for a given source and the semantics associated with that metadata.  Templates also specify how the metadata
is rendered into specific citation styles, such as Chicago style or Evidence style.  Templates could be designed to
address specific record types and may be grouped by type (e.g., a group of templates for census records, or newspapers, or
US census records, or UK census records, etc.).  Templates could also be associated with other templates into libraries
such that a specific piece of citation metadata (e.g., a citation field named "Volume") has a shared semantic meanign across the set
of associated templates -- a template library. Perhaps a standard template library could be developed that would address the most
common citation needs.
</p><p/><p>
Citation templates have not been fully specified and are therefore outlined here in broad terms.  For now, this
section functions as a place holder for the needed specifications.  We will likely consider ideas like those expressed
at http://sourcetemplates.org/ when we define this portion of the specification.

# 6. Extensibility

## Extensions from Non-GEDCOM X Vocabularies

This specification provides the data types and properties that define GEDCOM X.
Other data types and vocabularies ("foreign vocabularies") can be used in
GEDCOM X data types.

## Extensions to the GEDCOM X Vocabulary

The GEDCOM X namespaces are reserved for future forward-compatible revisions
of GEDCOM X. Future versions of this specification could add new data types and
properties to the GEDCOM X vocabulary.  Software written to conform to this
version of the specification will not be able to process such extensions correctly
and, in fact, will not be able to distinguish such extensions from error.  For
the purposes of this discussion, unrecognized data types and properties from the
GEDCOM X vocabulary will be considered "foreign vocabularies".

## Processing Foreign Vocabularies

GEDCOM X Processors that encounter foreign vocabularies in a location that is
legal according to this specification MUST NOT stop processing or
signal an error.  It might be the case that the GEDCOM X Processor is
able to process the foreign vocabularies correctly and does so.  Otherwise,
such vocabularies are termed "unknown foreign vocabularies".

When unknown foreign vocabularies are encountered, GEDCOM X Processors MAY
bypass the foreign properties, type references, and textual content and
MUST NOT change their behavior as a result of the presence of the vocabulary.

<a id="extension-properties"/>

## Extension Properties

GEDCOM X allows properties of foreign vocabularies in any data type, except
where it is explicitly forbidden.

## Extension Types

GEDCOM X allows data types of foreign vocabularies to be referenced anywhere
data types are defined to be referenced. Examples of data type references include
name types, fact types, resource types, etc. GEDCOM X supplies its own set of
"known" data types and implementors are encouraged to use the list of known data
types as much as possible to preserve maximum compatibility.

## User-Defined Types

Some applications MAY allow data types to be provided. For example, a genealogy
application may provide a feature that allows a user to supply a "custom" fact
about the life of a person when the list of known fact types doesn't contain
the type of fact the user may want to add.

In the case where a user has supplied a title or description instead of selecting
a known data type, GEDCOM X recognizes the data URI scheme as defined by
[RFC 2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397).

# 7. Miscellaneous To Do

todo: add details about which properties are required.

todo: supply details about how GEDCOM X defines its evidence model.
