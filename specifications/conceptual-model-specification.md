# 1. Introduction

The GEDCOM X conceptual model is a specification of formal concepts and types
that are used to provide a standard model and vocabulary for describing genealogical
data. Genealogical data is structured by data types such as persons, 
relationships, and sources.

[![Conceptual Model Graph](https://github.com/atomkirk/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/support/conceptual-model-graph.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/atomkirk/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/support/conceptual-model-graph.pdf?raw=true)

## 1.1 Identifier, Version, and Dependencies

The identifier for this specification is:

`http://gedcomx.org/conceptual-model/v1`

For convenience, the GEDCOM X conceptual model may be referred to as "GEDCOM X 1.0".
This specification uses "GEDCOM X" internally.

This specification is depends on the GEDCOM X Date Model specification identified
by [`http://gedcomx.org/date-model/v1`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/date-model-specification.md).

## 1.2 Notational Conventions

### 1.2.1 Keywords

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), as scoped to those conformance
targets.

### 1.2.2 Data Types and Data Instances

This specification uses the term "data type" to refer to a formal description of
a data structure, including the properties that define valid instances of the
data type. For example, information about a person might be contained within a 
data structure that supplies the person's name, birth date, and gender. A "data 
type" defines the formal properties of the data structure.

When a property of a data type is specified as being of a particular data type, the
property inherits the corresponding requirements from that data type's definition.
When a data type is specified as an extension of another data type, the extending
data type inherits the corresponding requirements from the extended data type's
definition.

Data types are defined by the following sections:

1. The *identifier* for the data type, which takes the form of a URI.
2. The *extension* of the data type (if any) which specifies which data type
   is extended by the data type.
3. The *properties* of the data type, which define the information the data type
   encapsulates.

This specification uses the term "data instance" to refer to the notion of a particular
instance, or instantiation, of a data type.

### 1.2.3 Controlled Vocabularies

GEDCOM X defines a set of controlled vocabularies for the purposes of identifying the semantic
context of data instances. A controlled vocabulary is often defined to create a set
of "known types" of data instances such as facts, names, genders, etc. For example, a controlled
vocabulary is specified to identify the set of known types of events so applications
can share semantic context of the event.

Elements of a controlled vocabulary are identified by URI.

## 1.2.4 The URI Reference

The Uniform Resource Identifier ("URI") is fundamental to the GEDCOM X conceptual model.
The URI is used to identify both the data types and data instances. The
URI is also used to identify elements of the controlled vocabularies defined by GEDCOM X.
The URI is specified by [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

GEDCOM X resources use the URI to reference other entities. For example, a GEDCOM X `Relationship`
identifies a person in the relationship by referencing a URI that identifies the person. When a property
(such as the `person1` property of `Relationship`) is of type `URI`, the value of the property
is interpreted as a "URI Reference" as defined by [RFC 3986, section 4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4).
This specification uses the term "URI" to refer to both a "URI" and a "URI Reference" as
defined by [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

<a id="formal-values" />

### 1.2.5 Original, Normalized, and Standardized Values

When a property is identified as an "original value", the value of the property
is interpreted as the literal value supplied by a user. If a property is identified as a
"normalized value", the value of the property is assumed to be formally formatted (either by
a user or by the application) for the purpose of easier processing, such as for display
purposes. When a property has been identified as a "standardized value", the value of the
property resolves to a discrete, machine-identifiable value based on a specific standard.

## 1.3 Internationalization Considerations

GEDCOM X must be designed to accommodate users and software of different languages and locales.
To this end, a property named `lang` is supported on relevant GEDCOM X data types. This
attribute is used to identify the locale of the user who provided the data. This property
is optional, and when it is not provided, a processor MAY process the data as if it were
provided in the default locale of the processor. When this property is provided, it overrides
the value of the property supplied by any containing data elements.

The values of the attribute are language identifiers as defined by [IETF BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47),
_Tags for the Identification of Languages_; in addition, the empty string may be specified to
explicitly state a processor may process the data as if it were provided in the default locale
of the processor.

In order to prevent undue burden on producers and consumers of GEDCOM X data, not all data types
provide multiple values for properties that are used for user input. For example, the text of
a note is _not_ defined as a list of language-identified strings. However, some cases have been
identified where multi-valued input is needed for the benefit of exchanging genealogical data
across cultural boundaries. Such cases include the need to input multiple name forms and the need
to identify multiple titles for a source.

## 1.4 Compliance

An implementation of the GEDCOM X conceptual model is "non-compliant" if it fails to satisfy
one or more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements. An implementation that satisfies all of
the  MUST or REQUIRED and all of the SHOULD level requirements is said to be "unconditionally
compliant"; and implementation that satisfies all of the MUST level requirements but not all of the
SHOULD level requirements is said to be "conditionally compliant".

# 2. Top-Level Data Types

The data types in this section are designated as "top-level" data types because they define the
top-level units of genealogical data. A GEDCOM X data set is defined as a collection of instances
of top-level data types. The definitions of top-level data types stand separately
from the definitions of other top-level data types and the lifecycle of instances of these data
types is distinct from the lifecycle of instances of the other top-level data types.

`person1` property refers to the parent and the `person2` property refers to the
child.

Values range from −90.0 degrees (south) to 90.0 degrees (north).  It is assumed that all instances of `PlaceDescription` that share identical `about` values will also have identical `latitude` values.
longitude | Angular distance in degrees, relative to the Prime Meridian. | IEEE 754 binary64 value | OPTIONAL.  If provided, MUST provide `latitude` also.  Values range from −180.0 degrees (west of the Meridian) to 180.0 degrees (east of the Meridian).

# 3. Component-Level Data Types

The data types in this section are designated as "component-level" data types because they are
designed to be referenced and re-used by other data types, most notably the top-level data types.
The lifecycle of instances of these data types is generally tied to the lifecycle of instances of
a top-level data type.

<a id="identifier-type"/>


## 3.1 The "Identifier" Data Type

The `Identifier` data type defines the data structure used to supply an identifier of a 
genealogical resource in a specific data set.

The `Identifier` data type does NOT support extension properties (see [Extension Properties](#extension-properties)).

### identifier

The identifier for the "Identifier" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Identifier`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
value | The value of the identifier. | [URI](#uri) | REQUIRED.
type  | URI identifying the type of the identifier. | [URI](#uri) | OPTIONAL. If provided, MUST resolve to an identifier type, and use of a [known identifier type](#known-identifier-types) is RECOMMENDED.

<a id="known-identifier-types"/>

### known identifier types

The following identifier types are defined by GEDCOM X.

URI | description
----|------------
`http://gedcomx.org/Primary` | The primary identifier for the resource.
`http://gedcomx.org/Evidence` | An identifier for the evidence that supports the resource. For example, when a conclusion about a person is extracted, analyzed and evaluated atomically within the context of a single source, it takes the form of a (extracted) person conclusion, and the extracted conclusion may supply an identifier for the person. As all evidence for the person is gathered, the (working) person conclusion identifies the evidence used to support the conclusion by including each evidence identifier in the list of identifiers for the person.
`http://gedcomx.org/Deprecated` | An identifier that has been relegated, deprecated, or otherwise downgraded. This identifier is commonly used as the result of a merge when what was once a primary identifier for a person is no longer primary.
`http://gedcomx.org/Persistent` | An identifier that is considered to be a long-term persistent identifier. Applications that provide persistent identifiers are claiming that links to the resource using the identifier won't break.

### examples

* Person "12345" merges into Person "67890". Person "67890" assumes identifier "12345". Identifier "12345" is of type `http://gedcomx.org/Deprecated`
  because the merged person "12345" now uses identifier "67890".
* An online web application issues a persistent identifier of value `https://familysearch.org/pal:/12345` to a `Person` and the same identifier
  is used as the primary identifier for the `Person`. The list of identifiers for the `Person` contains two identifiers with value `https://familysearch.org/pal:/12345`,
  one of type `http://gedcomx.org/Primary` and one of type `http://gedcomx.org/Persistent`.
* An application allows a researcher to extract information from a single census record about a person. The application assigns an identifier "abcde" to the
  `Person` extracted from the census record. The researcher extracts additional information about the person from a birth certificate and the application
  assigns identifier "fghij" to the `Person` extracted from the birth certificate. As the researcher gathers and analyzes the evidence for the person, the
  application creates a (working) `Person` conclusion that references the census record and the birth certificate as a source. When the researcher concludes
  that person "abcde" and person "fghij" are the same person, the list of identifiers for the working `Person` includes two identifiers of type
  `http://gedcomx.org/Evidence`: "abcde" and "fghij".


<a id="attribution"/>

## 3.2 The "Attribution" Data Type

The `Attribution` data type defines the data structure used to attribute _who_, _when_, and _why_ to
genealogical data. Data is attributed to the agent who made the _latest significant change_ to the nature
of the data being attributed. The definition of a "significant change" is outside the scope of this specification
and is left to the implementer of the application.

#### The Granularity of Attribution

The granularity of data that is attributed varies widely from application to application. Some highly collaborative applications
might take a fine-grained approach, tracking attribution at the level of names, facts, and source references. Single-user
applications might simply provide attribution for a large set of data, such as an entire data tree. GEDCOM X explicitly
defines attribution for top-level entities such as persons, relationships, and documents, but also recognizes attribution
as an extension property that can be applied at a finer level of granularity. (For more information about extension properties,
see Section 6). For all data types where attribution is explicitly recognized, it is an OPTIONAL property.

If data is not explicitly attributed, the attribution for the data is assumed to be the attribution for the containing
data. For example, if no attribution is provided for the name of a person (as an extension property of the name), then the
attribution for the name is assumed to be the attribution of the person that contains the name. If no attribution for the
person is provided, the attribution is assumed to be the attribution for the data set that contains the person.

### identifier

The identifier for the "Attribution" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Attribution`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
contributor | Reference to the agent to whom the attributed data is attributed. | [URI](#uri) | OPTIONAL. If provided, MUST resolve to an instance of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Agent`](#agent).
modified | Timestamp of when the attributed data was contributed. | timestamp | OPTIONAL.
changeMessage | A statement of why the attributed data is being provided by the contributor. | string | OPTIONAL.

### examples

todo:


<a id="note"/>

## 3.3 The "Note" Data Type

The `Note` data type defines a note that was contributed from genealogical research.

Notes are not intended to contain genealogical conclusions.  Notes are only associated with a single genealogical resource.

### identifier

The identifier for the "Note" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Note`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
lang | The locale identifier for the note. | [IETF BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) locale tag | OPTIONAL. If not provided, the locale of the containing resource of the note is assumed.
subject | A subject or title for the note. | string | OPTIONAL.
text | The text of the note. | string | REQUIRED.
attribution | The attribution of this note. | [`http://gedcomx.org/Attribution`](#attribution) | OPTIONAL. If not provided, the attribution of the containing resource of the note is assumed.


<a id="text-value"/>

Building source citations is said to be an "art" and requires a great deal of flexibility.  While citation style
guides exist (e.g. Chicago style, Turabian, Evidence Style -- see <i>Evidence Explained</i> by Elizabeth Shown Mills,
etc.), they are considered guides and execution within their guidelines allows for flexibility.
No one style has been universally accepted, nor will a style become universally accepted in the forseeable future.  Therefore,
the approach to collecting citation metadata and the exchange of this data needs to support flexibility.
</p><p/><p>
The citation metadata is collected as a set of name-value pairs (see the CitationField data type), but there still remains
a set of difficult questions, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the set of valid "names" (e.g. controlled vocabulary)?</li>
  <li>What "values" are valid values for a given "name"?</li>
  <li>What fields (name-value pairs) are required, and under what circumstances might they be optional?</li>
  <li>What metadata needs to be collected to properly site data in a specific record?  For example, is a citation for the 1900 US Census
different from a citation for the 1910 US Census and from a citation for the 1911 England and Wales Census?</li>
</ul>
<p/><p>
Further questions remain about how to arrange the fields into citations. For example, given a set of metadata, can it be expressed
in the Chicago style?  The Evidence style?  What about a lesser-used or custom style?
</p><p/><p>
To address these design issues, we define <b><i>citation templates</i></b>.  A citation template defines the metadata that should
be collected for a given source and the semantics associated with that metadata.  Templates also specify how the metadata
is rendered into specific citation styles, such as Chicago style or Evidence style.  Templates could be designed to
address specific record types and may be grouped by type (e.g., a group of templates for census records, or newspapers, or
US census records, or UK census records, etc.).  Templates could also be associated with other templates into libraries
such that a specific piece of citation metadata (e.g., a citation field named "Volume") has a shared semantic meanign across the set
of associated templates -- a template library. Perhaps a standard template library could be developed that would address the most
common citation needs.
</p><p/><p>
Citation templates have not been fully specified and are therefore outlined here in broad terms.  For now, this
section functions as a place holder for the needed specifications.  We will likely consider ideas like those expressed
at http://sourcetemplates.org/ when we define this portion of the specification.

<a id="name-conclusion"/>

## 3.13 The "Name" Data Type

The `Name` data type defines a conclusion about a name of a person.

A `Name` is intended to represent a single variant of a person's name.  This means that nicknames, spelling variations,
or other name variants (often distinguishable by a name type) should be modeled with separate instances of `Name`.

The name forms of a name contain representations of this name.  A `Name` MUST contain at least one name form, presumably
a representation of the name that is considered proper and well formed in the person's native, historical cultural context.
Other name forms MAY be included, which can be used to represent this name in contexts where the native name form is not
easily recognized and interpreted.  Alternate forms are more likely in situations where conclusions are being analyzed
across cultural context boundaries that have both language and writing script differences.

For example, a Korean name has a native Korean form, but can also have a Chinese form and a Roman/Latin form -- three
different name forms, but each representing the same name.

If more than one name form is provided, included name forms are assumed to be given in order of preference, with the
most preferred name form in the first position in the list.

### identifier

The identifier for the `Name` data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Name`

### extension

This data type extends the following data type:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Conclusion`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
type | URI identifying the type of the name. | [URI](#uri) | OPTIONAL. If provided, MUST resolve to a name type, and use of a [known name type](#known-name-types) is RECOMMENDED.
preferred | Whether this name is preferred above the other `Name` conclusions of a person. | boolean | OPTIONAL.
date | The date of applicability of the name. | [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Date`](#conclusion-date) | OPTIONAL.
nameForms | The name form(s) that best express this name, usually representations considered proper and well formed in the person's native, historical cultural context. All included name forms SHOULD be representations of the same name, and NOT variants of the name (e.g., nicknames, spelling variations). | List of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/NameForm`](#name-form). Order is preserved. | REQUIRED. At least one name form MUST be provided.

### examples

Consider the following: a Russian person with the birth name "Александр" (rendered as "Alexander" in English and in a Latin script) that
also went by this name's common nickname, "Саша" (rendered as "Sasha" in English).

It is tempting to think that this situation should be modeled with one `Name` instance that has several alternate `NameForm`s.  The model is
__*not*__ intended to be used in this way. Instead, this person's names ought to be modeled such that the birth name and the nickname are modeled
as two separate `Name` instances: one instance for the birth name, and one for the nickname.  The `type` property MAY be provided to distinguish
the birth name from the nickname. Each `Name` instance MAY have two `NameForm` instances: one with the native form of the name and another with
the alternate form.  Using an informal pseudo code, it might look something like the following:

```
Name1.type=http://gedcomx.org/BirthName
Name1.preferred=true
Name1.nameForms[0].fullText=Александр
Name1.nameForms[1].fullText=Alexander

Name2.type=http://gedcomx.org/Nickname
Name2.preferred=false
Name2.nameForms[0].fullText=Саша
Name2.nameForms[1].fullText=Sasha
```

## 3.19 The "NameForm" Data Type

The `NameForm` data type defines a representation of a name (a "name form") within a given cultural context,
such as a given language and script.

As names are captured (in records or in applications), the terms in the name are sometimes classified by type.
For example, a certificate of death might prompt for "given name(s)" and "surname". The `parts` list can be
used to represent the terms in the name that have been classified.

If both a full rendering of the name and a list of parts are provided, it NOT REQUIRED that every
term in the fully rendered name appear in the list of parts.

Name parts in the `parts` list are presumed to be ordered in the natural order they would be spoken in the given
cultural context.

If a full rendering of the name is not provided (i.e., the name has only been expressed in `part`s), a full
rendering of the name can be derived (sans punctuation) by concatenating, in order, each `NamePart.value` in the
`parts` list, separating each part with the name part delimiter appropriate for the given `locale`.

### identifier

The identifier for the `NameForm` data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/NameForm`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
lang | The locale identifier for the name form. | [IETF BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) locale tag | OPTIONAL. If not provided, the locale of the current user of the data is assumed.
fullText | A full rendering of the name (or as much of the name as is known) with the terms in the name given in the natural order they would be spoken in the applicable cultural context. | string | OPTIONAL.
parts | The parts of the name form, ordered in the natural order they would be spoken in the given cultural context. | List of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/NamePart`](#name-part). Order is preserved. | OPTIONAL.

### examples

Consider the following: the Russian name "Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский" in the Cyrillic script, its Latin-scr
ipt equivalent "Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky", and its anglicised equivalent "Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky".
Using an informal pseudo code, these name forms might be modeled as follows:

```
NameForm1.locale=ru-Cyrl
NameForm1.fullText=Пётр Ильи́ч Чайко́вский
NameForm1.parts[0].type=http://gedcomx.org/Given
NameForm1.parts[0].value=Пётр
NameForm1.parts[0].qualifiers[0]=http://gedcomx.org/First
NameForm1.parts[1].type=http://gedcomx.org/Middle
NameForm1.parts[1].value=Ильи́ч
NameForm1.parts[1].qualifiers[0]=http://gedcomx.org/Middle
NameForm1.parts[2].type=http://gedcomx.org/Surname
NameForm1.parts[2].value=Чайко́вский

NameForm2.locale=ru-Latn
NameForm2.fullText=Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
NameForm2.parts[0].type=http://gedcomx.org/Given
NameForm2.parts[0].value=Pyotr
NameForm2.parts[0].qualifiers[0]=http://gedcomx.org/First
NameForm2.parts[1].type=http://gedcomx.org/Given
NameForm2.parts[1].value=Ilyich
NameForm2.parts[1].qualifiers[0]=http://gedcomx.org/Middle
NameForm2.parts[2].type=http://gedcomx.org/Surname
NameForm2.parts[2].value=Tchaikovsky

NameForm3.locale=en-Latn
NameForm3.fullText=Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky
NameForm3.parts[0].type=http://gedcomx.org/Given
NameForm3.parts[0].value=Peter
NameForm3.parts[0].qualifiers[0]=http://gedcomx.org/First
NameForm3.parts[1].type=http://gedcomx.org/Given
NameForm3.parts[1].value=Ilyich
NameForm3.parts[1].qualifiers[0]=http://gedcomx.org/Middle
NameForm3.parts[2].type=http://gedcomx.org/Surname
NameForm3.parts[2].value=Tchaikovsky

## 3.20 The "Qualifier" Data Type

The `Qualifier` data type defines the data structure used to supply additional details, annotations, tags, or other qualifying data
to a specific data element.

### identifier

The identifier for the "Qualifier" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Qualifier`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
name | The name of the qualifier, used to determine the nature of the qualifier. | [URI](#uri) | REQUIRED. It is RECOMMENDED that the qualifier name resolve to an element of a constrained vocabulary.
value | The value of the qualifier. The semantic meaning of the value is determined by the qualifier name. | string | OPTIONAL.

# 4. Extensibility

## Extensions from Non-GEDCOM X Vocabularies

This specification provides the data types and properties that define GEDCOM X.
Other data types and vocabularies ("foreign vocabularies") can be used in
GEDCOM X data types.

## Extensions to the GEDCOM X Vocabulary

The GEDCOM X namespaces are reserved for future forward-compatible revisions
of GEDCOM X. Future versions of this specification could add new data types and
properties to the GEDCOM X vocabulary.  Software written to conform to this
version of the specification will not be able to process such extensions correctly
and, in fact, will not be able to distinguish such extensions from error.  For
the purposes of this discussion, unrecognized data types and properties from the
GEDCOM X vocabulary will be considered "foreign vocabularies".

## Processing Foreign Vocabularies

GEDCOM X Processors that encounter foreign vocabularies in a location that is
legal according to this specification MUST NOT stop processing or
signal an error.  It might be the case that the GEDCOM X Processor is
able to process the foreign vocabularies correctly and does so.  Otherwise,
such vocabularies are termed "unknown foreign vocabularies".

When unknown foreign vocabularies are encountered, GEDCOM X Processors MAY
bypass the foreign properties, type references, and textual content and
MUST NOT change their behavior as a result of the presence of the vocabulary.

<a id="extension-properties"/>

## Extension Properties

GEDCOM X allows properties of foreign vocabularies in any data type, except
where it is explicitly forbidden.

## Extension Types

GEDCOM X allows data types of foreign vocabularies to be referenced anywhere
data types are defined to be referenced. Examples of data type references include
name types, fact types, resource types, etc. GEDCOM X supplies its own set of
"known" data types and implementors are encouraged to use the list of known data
types as much as possible to preserve maximum compatibility.

## User-Defined Types

Some applications MAY allow data types to be provided. For example, a genealogy
application may provide a feature that allows a user to supply a "custom" fact
about the life of a person when the list of known fact types doesn't contain
the type of fact the user may want to add.

In the case where a user has supplied a title or description instead of selecting
a known data type, GEDCOM X recognizes the data URI scheme as defined by
[RFC 2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397).
