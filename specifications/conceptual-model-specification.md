# 1. Introduction

The GEDCOM X conceptual model is a specification of formal concepts and types
that are used to provide a standard model and vocabulary for describing genealogical
data. Genealogical data is structured by data types such as persons, 
relationships, and sources.

[![Conceptual Model Graph](https://github.com/atomkirk/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/support/conceptual-model-graph.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/atomkirk/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/support/conceptual-model-graph.pdf?raw=true)

## 1.1 Identifier, Version, and Dependencies

The identifier for this specification is:

`http://gedcomx.org/conceptual-model/v1`

For convenience, the GEDCOM X conceptual model may be referred to as "GEDCOM X Conceptual Model 1.0".
This specification uses "GEDCOM X" or "GEDCOM X Conceptual Model" internally.

This specification is depends on the GEDCOM X Date Model specification identified
by [`http://gedcomx.org/date-model/v1`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/date-model-specification.md).

This specification refers to the GEDCOM X Event Types specification identified
by [`http://gedcomx.org/event-types/v1`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/event-types-specification.md)
to recommend event types to be used.

This specification refers to the GEDCOM X Fact Types specification identified
by [`http://gedcomx.org/fact-types/v1`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/fact-types-specification.md)
to recommend fact types to be used.

This specification refers to the GEDCOM X Name Part Qualifiers specification identified
by [`http://gedcomx.org/name-part-qualifiers/v1`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/name-part-qualifiers-specification.md)
to recommend name part qualifiers to be used.

## 1.2 Notational Conventions

### 1.2.1 Keywords

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14,
[RFC2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), as scoped to those conformance
targets.

### 1.2.2 Data Types and Data Instances

This specification uses the term "data type" to refer to a formal description of
a data structure, including the properties that define valid instances of the
data type. For example, information about a person might be contained within a 
data structure that supplies the person's name, birth date, and gender. A "data 
type" defines the formal properties of the data structure.

When a property of a data type is specified as being of a particular data type, the
property inherits the corresponding requirements from that data type's definition.
When a data type is specified as an extension of another data type, the extending
data type inherits the corresponding requirements from the extended data type's
definition.

Data types are defined by the following sections:

1. The *identifier* for the data type, which takes the form of a URI.
2. The *extension* of the data type (if any) which specifies which data type
   is extended by the data type.
3. The *properties* of the data type, which define the information the data type
   encapsulates.

This specification uses the term "data instance" to refer to the notion of a particular
instance, or instantiation, of a data type.

<a name="uri"/>

### 1.2.3 Controlled Vocabularies

GEDCOM X defines a set of controlled vocabularies for the purposes of identifying the semantic
context of data instances. A controlled vocabulary is often defined to create a set
of "known types" of data instances such as facts, names, genders, etc. For example, a controlled
vocabulary is specified to identify the set of known types of events so applications
can share semantic context of the event.

Elements of a controlled vocabulary are identified by an enumerated value.

## 1.2.4 The URI Reference

The Uniform Resource Identifier ("URI") is fundamental to the GEDCOM X Conceptual Model.
The URI is used to identify both the data types and data instances. The
URI is also used to identify elements of the controlled vocabularies defined by GEDCOM X.
The URI is specified by [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

GEDCOM X resources use the URI to reference other entities. For example, a GEDCOM X `Relationship`
identifies a person in the relationship by referencing a URI that identifies the person. When a property
(such as the `person1` property of `Relationship`) is of type `URI`, the value of the property
is interpreted as a "URI Reference" as defined by [RFC 3986, section 4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4).
This specification uses the term "URI" to refer to both a "URI" and a "URI Reference" as
defined by [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).

<a name="formal-values" />

### 1.2.5 Original and Normalized Values

When a property is identified as an "original value", the value of the property
is interpreted as the literal value supplied by a user. If a property is identified as a
"normalized value", the value of the property is assumed to be formally formatted (either by
a user or by the application) for the purpose of easier processing, such as for display
purposes.

<a name="enumerated-value"/>

### 1.2.6 Enumerated Values

Enumerated values are used throughout GEDCOM X to constrain values of properties to a limited (though
not necessarily small) number of possibilities. Enumerated values are used to ensure portability and must
be a discrete, machine-identifiable value based on a specific specification.  Enumerated values take the
form of a URI. Members of controlled vocabularies are enumerated values.

## 1.3 Internationalization Considerations

GEDCOM X must be designed to accommodate users and software of different languages and locales.
To this end, a property named `lang` is supported on relevant GEDCOM X data types. This
attribute is used to identify the locale of the user who provided the data. This property
is optional, and when it is not provided, a processor MAY process the data as if it were
provided in the default locale of the processor. When this property is provided, it overrides
the value of the property supplied by any containing data elements.

The values of the attribute are language identifiers as defined by [IETF BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47),
_Tags for the Identification of Languages_; in addition, the empty string may be specified to
explicitly state a processor may process the data as if it were provided in the default locale
of the processor.

In order to prevent undue burden on producers and consumers of GEDCOM X data, not all data types
provide multiple values for properties that are used for user input. For example, the text of
a note is _not_ defined as a list of language-identified strings. However, some cases have been
identified where multi-valued input is needed for the benefit of exchanging genealogical data
across cultural boundaries. Such cases include the need to input multiple name forms and the need
to identify multiple titles for a source.

## 1.4 Compliance

An implementation of the GEDCOM X Conceptual Model is "non-compliant" if it fails to satisfy
one or more of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements. An implementation that satisfies all of
the  MUST or REQUIRED and all of the SHOULD level requirements is said to be "unconditionally
compliant"; and implementation that satisfies all of the MUST level requirements but not all of the
SHOULD level requirements is said to be "conditionally compliant".

# 2. Top-Level Data Types

The data types in this section are designated as "top-level" data types because they define the
top-level units of genealogical data. A GEDCOM X data set is defined as a collection of instances
of top-level data types. The definitions of top-level data types stand separately
from the definitions of other top-level data types and the lifecycle of instances of these data
types is distinct from the lifecycle of instances of the other top-level data types.


<a name="person"/>

facts | The conclusions about the facts of the life of the relationship. | List of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Fact`](#fact-conclusion). Order is preserved. | OPTIONAL.

Note: when a relationship type implies direction, the relationship is said to
be *from* person1 *to* person2. For example, in a parent-child relationship, the
`person1` property refers to the parent and the `person2` property refers to the
child.

It is assumed that all instances of `PlaceDescription` that share an identical `Primary` identifier will also have identical `latitude` values.
longitude | Angular distance in degrees, relative to the Prime Meridian. | IEEE 754 binary64 value | OPTIONAL.  If provided, MUST provide `latitude` also.  Values range from −180.0 degrees (west of the Meridian) to 180.0 degrees (east of the Meridian).  It is assumed that all instances of `PlaceDescription` that share an identical `Primary` identifier will also have identical `longitude` values.
spatialDescription | A reference to a geospatial description of this place. | [`URI`](#uri) | OPTIONAL. It is RECOMMENDED that this geospatial description resolve to a KML document.

Note:  Multiple descriptions of the same place MAY be correlated via the `http://gedcomx.org/Primary` identifier.


# 3. Component-Level Data Types

The data types in this section are designated as "component-level" data types because they are
designed to be referenced and re-used by other data types, most notably the top-level data types.
The lifecycle of instances of these data types is generally tied to the lifecycle of instances of
a top-level data type.


<a name="identifier-type"></a>

## 3.1 The "Identifier" Data Type

The `Identifier` data type defines the data structure used to supply an identifier of a 
genealogical resource in a specific data set.

The `Identifier` data type does NOT support extension properties (see [Extension Properties](#extension-properties)).

### identifier

The identifier for the "Identifier" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Identifier`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
value | The value of the identifier. | [URI](#uri) | REQUIRED.
type  | Enumerated value identifying the type of the identifier. | [Enumerated Value](#enumerated-value) | OPTIONAL. If provided, MUST identify an identifier type, and use of a [known identifier type](#known-identifier-types) is RECOMMENDED.

<a name="known-identifier-types"/>

### known identifier types

The following identifier types are defined by GEDCOM X.

URI | description
----|------------
`http://gedcomx.org/Primary` | The primary identifier for the resource.
`http://gedcomx.org/Deprecated` | An identifier that has been relegated, deprecated, or otherwise downgraded. This identifier is commonly used as the result of a merge when what was once a primary identifier for a person is no longer primary.
`http://gedcomx.org/Persistent` | An identifier that is considered to be a long-term persistent identifier. Applications that provide persistent identifiers are claiming that links to the resource using the identifier won't break.

### examples

* Person "12345" merges into Person "67890". Person "67890" assumes identifier "12345". Identifier "12345" is of type `http://gedcomx.org/Deprecated`
  because the merged person "12345" now uses identifier "67890".
* An online web application issues a persistent identifier of value `https://familysearch.org/pal:/12345` to a `Person` and the same identifier
  is used as the primary identifier for the `Person`. The list of identifiers for the `Person` contains two identifiers with value `https://familysearch.org/pal:/12345`,
  one of type `http://gedcomx.org/Primary` and one of type `http://gedcomx.org/Persistent`.


<a name="attribution"/>

## 3.2 The "Attribution" Data Type

The `Attribution` data type defines the data structure used to attribute _who_, _when_, and _why_ to
genealogical data. Data is attributed to the agent who made the _latest significant change_ to the nature
of the data being attributed. The definition of a "significant change" is outside the scope of this specification
and is left to the implementer of the application.

#### The Granularity of Attribution

The granularity of data that is attributed varies widely from application to application. Some highly collaborative applications
might take a fine-grained approach, tracking attribution at the level of names, facts, and source references. Single-user
applications might simply provide attribution for a large set of data, such as an entire data tree. GEDCOM X explicitly
defines attribution for top-level entities such as persons, relationships, and documents, but also recognizes attribution
as an extension property that can be applied at a finer level of granularity. (For more information about extension properties,
see Section 6). For all data types where attribution is explicitly recognized, it is an OPTIONAL property.

If data is not explicitly attributed, the attribution for the data is assumed to be the attribution for the containing
data. For example, if no attribution is provided for the name of a person (as an extension property of the name), then the
attribution for the name is assumed to be the attribution of the person that contains the name. If no attribution for the
person is provided, the attribution is assumed to be the attribution for the data set that contains the person.

### identifier

The identifier for the "Attribution" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Attribution`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
contributor | Reference to the agent to whom the attributed data is attributed. | [URI](#uri) | OPTIONAL. If provided, MUST resolve to an instance of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Agent`](#agent).
modified | Timestamp of when the attributed data was contributed. | timestamp | OPTIONAL.
changeMessage | A statement of why the attributed data is being provided by the contributor. | string | OPTIONAL.

### examples

todo:


<a name="note"/>

## 3.3 The "Note" Data Type

The `Note` data type defines a note that was contributed from genealogical research.

Notes are not intended to contain genealogical conclusions.  Notes are only associated with a single genealogical resource.

### identifier

The identifier for the "Note" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Note`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------

<a name="text-value"/>

## 3.4 The "TextValue" Data Type

The `TextValue` data type defines a literal text value.

The `TextValue` data type does NOT support extension properties (see [Extension Properties](#extension-properties)).

### identifier

The identifier for the "TextValue" data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/TextValue`

### properties

<a name="subject"/>

## 3.11 The "Subject" Data Type

The `Subject` data type defines the abstract concept of a genealogical _subject_.

A _subject_ is something with a unique and intrinsic identity&mdash;e.g., a person, a location on the surface of the earth. We
identify that _subject_ in time and space using various supporting _conclusions_—for a person: things like name, birth date, age,
address, etc. We aggregate these supporting _conclusions_ to form an apparently-unique identity by which we can distinguish our
_subject_ from all other possible _subjects_.

In all cases, it seems that a _subject_ can also be used as a supporting _conclusion_ for another _subject_. So a _subject_ can
be a _subject_ in one context and an supporting _conclusion_ in another.

On the other hand, not all supporting _conclusions_ are _subjects_. We may research and debate a `Fact` (where it took place,
when it took place, the spelling of the name, etc.), but it is always within the context of a _subject_ (where was _John_
born, when was _John_ born, how should we spell _John_'s name).

### identifier

The identifier for the `Subject` data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Subject`

### extension

This data type extends the following data type:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Conclusion`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
extracted | Whether this _subject_ is to be constrained as an _extracted conclusion_. | boolean | OPTIONAL. Default: `false`. Refer to [Extracted Conclusion Constraints](#extracted-conclusion-constraints).
evidence | References to _subject_ instances that support this _subject_. | List of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/EvidenceReference`](#evidence-reference). Order is preserved. | OPTIONAL.  If provided, each reference MUST resolve to an instance of _subject_ of the same _subject_ type as this instance (e.g., if the _subject_ is a `Person`, all evidence references must resolve to instances of `Person`).
media | References to multimedia resources for this _subject_, such as photos or videos. Media references are intended to provide additional context or illustration for the _subject_ and ARE NOT being considered as evidence supporting the _subject_ and its associated _conclusions_. Media references SHOULD be ordered by priority such that applications that wish to display a single media item (such as an image) MAY choose the first applicable media reference. | List of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/SourceReference`](#source-reference) | OPTIONAL. Note that the `SourceReference` is used for multimedia references and therefore MUST resolve to a `SourceDescription` of the resource, which in turn provides a reference to the resource itself.
identifiers | Identifiers for this _subject_. | List of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Identifier`](#identifier-type). Order is preserved. | OPTIONAL.
attribution | The attribution of this _subject_. | [`http://gedcomx.org/Attribution`](#attribution) | OPTIONAL. If not provided, the attribution of the containing data set (e.g. file) of the _subject_ is assumed.


<a name="gender"/>

## 3.12 The "Gender" Data Type

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
type  | Enumerated value identifying the type of the gender. | [Enumerated Value](#enumerated-value) | REQUIRED. MUST identify a gender type, and use of a [known gender type](#known-gender-types) is RECOMMENDED.

`http://gedcomx.org/Male`| Male gender.
`http://gedcomx.org/Female`| Female gender.
`http://gedcomx.org/Unknown`| Unknown gender.


<a name="name-conclusion"/>

## 3.13 The "Name" Data Type

The `Name` data type defines a conclusion about a name of a person.

A `Name` is intended to represent a single variant of a person's name.  This means that nicknames, spelling variations,
or other name variants (often distinguishable by a name type) should be modeled with separate instances of `Name`.

The name forms of a name contain representations of this name.  A `Name` MUST contain at least one name form, presumably
a representation of the name that is considered proper and well formed in the person's native, historical cultural context.
Other name forms MAY be included, which can be used to represent this name in contexts where the native name form is not
easily recognized and interpreted.  Alternate forms are more likely in situations where conclusions are being analyzed
across cultural context boundaries that have both language and writing script differences.

For example, a Korean name has a native Korean form, but can also have a Chinese form and a Roman/Latin form -- three
different name forms, but each representing the same name.

If more than one name form is provided, included name forms are assumed to be given in order of preference, with the
most preferred name form in the first position in the list.

### identifier

The identifier for the `Name` data type is:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Name`

### extension

This data type extends the following data type:

`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Conclusion`

### properties

name  | description | data type | constraints
------|-------------|-----------|------------
type | Enumerated value identifying the type of the name. | [Enumerated Value](#enumerated-value) | OPTIONAL. If provided, MUST identify a name type, and use of a [known name type](#known-name-types) is RECOMMENDED.
nameForms | The name form(s) that best express this name, usually representations considered proper and well formed in the person's native, historical cultural context. All included name forms SHOULD be representations of the same name, and NOT variants of the name (e.g., not a nicknames or spelling variation). | List of [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/NameForm`](#name-form). Order is preserved. | REQUIRED. At least one name form MUST be provided.
date | The date of applicability of the name. | [`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Date`](#conclusion-date) | OPTIONAL.

### examples

Consider the following: a Russian person with the birth name "Александр" (rendered as "Alexander" in English and in a Latin script) that
also went by this name's common nickname, "Саша" (rendered as "Sasha" in English).

It is tempting to think that this situation should be modeled with one `Name` instance that has several alternate `NameForm`s.  The model is
__*not*__ intended to be used in this way. Instead, this person's names ought to be modeled such that the birth name and the nickname are modeled
as two separate `Name` instances: one instance for the birth name, and one for the nickname.  The `type` property MAY be provided to distinguish
the birth name from the nickname. Each `Name` instance MAY have two `NameForm` instances: one with the native form of the name and another with
the alternate form.  Using an informal pseudo code, it might look something like the following:

```
Name1.type=http://gedcomx.org/BirthName
Name1.nameForms[0].fullText=Александр
Name1.nameForms[1].fullText=Alexander

Name2.type=http://gedcomx.org/Nickname
Name2.nameForms[0].fullText=Саша
Name2.nameForms[1].fullText=Sasha

## 3.19 The "NameForm" Data Type

The `NameForm` data type defines a representation of a name (a "name form") within a given cultural context,
such as a given language and script.

As names are captured (in records or in applications), the terms in the name are sometimes classified by type.
For example, a certificate of death might prompt for "given name(s)" and "surname". The `parts` list can be
used to represent the terms in the name that have been classified.

If both a full rendering of the name and a list of parts are provided, it NOT REQUIRED that every
term in the fully rendered name appear in the list of parts.

Name parts in the `parts` list are presumed to be ordered in the natural order they would be spoken in the given
cultural context.

If a full rendering of the name is not provided (i.e., the name has only been expressed in `part`s), a full
rendering of the name can be derived (sans punctuation) by concatenating, in order, each `NamePart.value` in the
`parts` list, separating each part with the name part delimiter appropriate for the given `locale`.

# 4. Extracted Conclusion Constraints

GEDCOM X provides a specific definition for the term "extracted conclusion" that is used to refer to a set of constraints
that MUST be applied to conclusion data that is identified as "extracted" using the `extracted` property.

When a conclusion is identified as "extracted", it means that the data is to be treated as having been extracted from a
single source or record.  An extracted conclusion is distinguished from other conclusion data by the notion that it is
intended to describe information contained in a single source, as opposed to what a researcher or system believes to be true
about the subject of the conclusion.

Applications MUST recognize the `extracted` property and SHOULD ensure that any modifications to the extracted conclusion are
aligned with the information that is provided by the specific (single) source, even if the source provides information that may
conflict with information in other sources.

Data in a conclusion that is identified as "extracted" MUST conform to the following constraints:

* The conclusion (including any data it contains) MUST NOT refer to more than one source description.
* All source references used by the conclusion MUST resolve to the same source description, although
  each reference MAY contain distinct qualifying information such as attribution.


<a name="persona"/>

## 4.1 Persona

GEDCOM X provides a specific definition for the term "persona" that is used to refer to an instance of
`http://gedcomx.org/v1/Person` that has been identified as an extracted conclusion.


# 5. Extensibility

Data types, properties, and enumerated values MAY be defined as extensions to GEDCOM X Conceptual Model by external
specifications. New data types, properties, and enumerated values MAY also be added by future versions of the
GEDCOM X Conceptual Model or by other GEDCOM X specifications. Implementations of this version of the specification
will not be able to process such extensions correctly and, in fact, will not be able to distinguish such extensions
from error.

This section defines the constraints by which implementations of the GEDCOM X Conceptual Model SHOULD identify
and process data types, properties, and enumerated values not defined by this version of GEDCOM X.

## 5.1 Data Type Extensions

New data types MAY be defined as extensions to GEDCOM X by providing the following:

* A description of the data type.
* An identifier for the data type.
* The data type being extended by the data type, if any.
* The properties of the data type.
* Examples needed to clarify the usage of the data type, if any.

The base URI `http://gedcomx.org/` is reserved for identifiers of data types defined by the GEDCOM X specification
set. Data types defined outside the scope of the GEDCOM X specification set MUST NOT use the value `http://gedcomx.org/`
as a base URI for the data type identifier.

Specifications that define new data types as GEDCOM X extensions MUST be published and made freely available and
compatible with the terms and constraints that govern the GEDCOM X Conceptual Model.

## 5.2 Enumerated Value Extensions

New enumerated values MAY be defined as extensions to GEDCOM X by providing the following:

* An identifier for each enumerated value.
* A description for each enumerated value.
* An identification of which properties of which data types to which new enumerated value applies.

The base URI for enumerated values defined by the GEDCOM X specification set is `http://gedcomx.org/`.
Enumerated values defined outside the scope of the GEDCOM X specification set MUST NOT use the value `http://gedcomx.org/`
as a base URI for the enumerated value identifier.

Specifications that define new enumerated values as GEDCOM X extensions MUST be published and made freely available and
compatible with the terms and constraints that govern the GEDCOM X Conceptual Model.

### 5.2.1 User-Defined Enumerated Values

Some applications MAY allow enumerated values to be provided by a user. For example, a genealogy
application may provide a feature that allows a user to describe a "custom" fact about a person
when there doesn't exist a formally specified enumerated value.

In the case where a user has supplied a title or description instead of selecting
a known enumerated value, GEDCOM X recognizes the data URI scheme as defined by
[RFC 2397](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397).

<a name="extension-properties"/>

## 5.3 Extension Properties

New properties MAY be defined as extensions to existing GEDCOM X data types by providing the following:

* The data type to which the property applies.
* A name of the property.
* A description of the property.
* The data type of the value of the property.
* Any constraints that are applicable to the property.

Extension properties MUST NOT be defined on data types that explicitly restrict extension properties.

Extension properties MUST NOT be defined as "REQUIRED".

Specifications that define new properties as GEDCOM X extensions MUST be published and made freely available and
compatible with the terms and constraints that govern the GEDCOM X Conceptual Model.

## 5.4 Processing Extensions

GEDCOM X implementations that encounter extensions in a location that is legal according to this specification SHOULD NOT stop processing or
signal an error, although implementations MAY signal nonfatal warnings. A GEDCOM X implementation MAY be able to process the extension
correctly and choose to do so.  Otherwise, GEDCOM X implementations MAY bypass the extensions and MUST NOT change their behavior as a result
of the presence of the extension.
