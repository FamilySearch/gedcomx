/**
 * The person summary resource defines a subset of information about a person, optimized for a summary view. The person summary is especially useful
 * for applications when providing quick access to the most useful data about a person, such as when retrieving a pedigree or when providing search
 * results.<br/><br/>
 *
 * A person summary should contain at least the living status, a preferred name, the gender, birth, and death of a person. Applications may choose to
 * provide additional information to meet the specific requirements of their products.<br/><br/>
 *
 * Note that the <tt>person</tt> element is used as the data format for the person summary resource, but the person summary resource is distinct from
 * the person resource.
